# Sparta Rails AR Models

This README document explains the use of Ruby-Rails following on from a previous task. The task relates to the use of Ruby on Rails to support a website with server side rendering through the use of Ruby on Rails. This task was found much easier than the previous one with understanding of what code needed to be altered to get the result required by the client. The website supports CRUD functionality sourced from a relational database (consisting of countries and tables).

### How To Set Up A Database

```rb
rake db:create
```

* Create the controllers and models.
* Migrate the information from the console which creates the controller + model by,   

```rb
rake db:migrate
```

* Insert the seed file to psuedo populate the tables, this is done by, 

```rb
rake db:seed
```

### Languages used
* Ruby...on rails
* Postgres
* HTML
* CSS (Bootstrap)
* SCSS
